# Hello Devs,

you can find packages names based on java --versions.\
which will give you proper understanding to learn java version wise.\
As currently for JDK we have used Java 17, but compile version scope is set to JDK 11.

### Also going each folder java7 and java8

will give you markdown file extension *.md, also if the topic is bigger, it will it's own level of *.md, hence for
better understanding,
please read the markdown in preview mode.
